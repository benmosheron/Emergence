    Colours are pretty interesting. 
    The colours in the line above were chosen at random - there are lots of different ways of picking random colours,
    and the method you choose will have a large affect on the set of colours you end up with.
</p>
<p>
    You can click the bar to pick a brand new set.

    Computers make it so easy to play around with random colours. The most common way to think about them (if you're a computer, anyway)
    is to break them down into their red, blue and green components.
</p>
<p>
    This is a nice way of thinking about things, because we can treat our colours as vectors composed of red, green and blue.
    Why on Earth is this nice...?! Because we can treat the three dimensions of colour in the same way we treat
    the three dimension of space, with which we are all very familiar.
    Every colour sits at a point in 3D colourspace, and we can mess with them with regular old mechanics!

<p>
    We can have a bunch of colour particles do random walks (i.e. bounce around randomly).
